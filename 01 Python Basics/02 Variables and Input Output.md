# 2	Variables and input/output 
## 2.1	Comments
Use # to comment a line of text
Code ‎2 1. Using comments in the text
``` C++
# This is a one-line comment, 
x = 5
y = 7
```

2.2	Variables
*	Does not need declaration, just assigned
*	Use the same naming convention as other programming languages, 
*	The variable is created the first time you assign it a value
*	Are references to objects
*	Type information is with the object, not the reference
*	Everything in Python is an object
*	(Variable) names can contain these characters:
o	a through z
o	A through Z
o	the underscore character _
o	digits 0 through 9
o	Names cannot start with a digit though

Code ‎2 2. Variable names
```
X1 = 5
MyFirstVariable = 7
FloatVraiable = 7.1
My_Variable = 7
```
## 2.3	Data types
*	The data type is a property of the object and not of the variable
*	Int, float, complex, etc.
### 2.3.1	Integer
*	Holds the whole number without the fraction
*	Negative, positive and zero 
*	It is an object
Code ‎2 3. A programme prints the sum of two integers
```
# Integer
x = 12
y = 92
z = x + y
print (z)
```
```
Execution
104
```
