# 1	Introduction
“Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressive-ness is endangered.”  Guido van Rossum

## 1.2	What is python
* Python is a general purpose programming language that is
* often applied in scripting roles.
* Python is programming language as well as scripting language.
* Python is also called as Interpreted language
* Invented in the Netherlands, early 90s by Guido van Rossum
* Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989
* Guido Van Rossum is fan of ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, this is a famous TV show in Netherlands Named after Monty Python
* Open sourced from the beginning
## 1.3	Features
*	Python is object-oriented
* * Structure supports such concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading, and multiple inheritance.
*	Indentation
* * Indentation is one of the greatest features in Python.
*	It's free (open source)
* * Downloading and installing Python is free and easy
* * Source code is easily accessible
*	It's powerful
* * Dynamic typing
* * Built-in types and tools
* * Library utilities
* * Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, SciPy)
* * Automatic memory management
*	It's portable
* * Python runs virtually every major platform used today
* * As long as you have a compatible Python interpreter installed, Python programs will run in exactly the same manner, irrespective of platform.
*	It's mixable
* * Python can be linked to components written in other languages easily
* * Linking to fast, compiled code is useful to computationally intensive problems
* * Python/C integration is quite common
*	It's easy to use
* * No intermediate compile and link steps as in C/ C++
* * Python programs are compiled automatically to an intermediate form called bytecode, which the interpreter then reads
* * This gives Python the development speed of an interpreter without the performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages
*	It's easy to learn
* * Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp
## 1.4	Differences between program and scripting language
### 1.4.1	Program Scripting
* A program is executed (i.e. the source is first compiled, and the result of that compilation is expected)
* A "program" in general, is a sequence of instructions written so that a computer can perform a certain task.
### 1.4.2 A script is interpreted
1. A "script" is code written in a scripting language.
1. A scripting language is a type of programming language in which we can write code to control another software application
### 1.4.3	Scope of Python
1.	Science
a.	Bioinformatics
2.	System Administration
a)	Unix
b)	Web logic
c)	Web sphere
3.	Web Application Development
a.	CGI
b.	Jython
c.	Servlets
4.	Testing scripts
## 1.5	Who uses python 
Python is being applied in real revenue-generating products by real companies. For instance:

* Google makes extensive use of Python in its web search system and employs Python’s creator.
* Intel, Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, Seagate, Qualcomm, and IBM use Python for hardware testing.
* ESRI uses Python as an end-user customization tool for its popular GIS mapping products. 
* The YouTube video sharing service is largely written in Python
## 1.6	Applications
* System programming
* Artificial Intelligence
* Computer vision
* Data Science
* Graphical User Interface Programming
* Internet Scripting
* Component Integration
* Database Programming
* Gaming, Images, XML , 
* Robot and more
## 1.7	Installing and using Python
Python is pre-installed on most Unix systems, including Linux and MAC OS X But for in Windows Operating Systems, user can download from the https://www.python.org/downloads/

* This will install the interpreter only and you can use it in an interactive mode only,
* You need to install ID for easier use
### 1.7.1	Running Interactively 
Press windows Key + R to rum the command mode:

### 1.7.2	IDE
Although using the command prompt is used widely but I personally do not recommend using it. It is highly recommended to use ID. Many IDEs are available starting from a simple notebook to more sophisticated ones:
#### 1.7.2.1	PyCharm
It is one of the popular IDEs and highly recommended by many programmers, you can download it from 
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
